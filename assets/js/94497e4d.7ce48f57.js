Or choose between safety and equal justice. \n    \n    Let\u2019s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \n    \n    That\u2019s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \n    \n    That\u2019s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption\u2014trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \n    \n    We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \n    \n    I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \n    \n    And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home\u2014they have no serial numbers and can\u2019t be traced. \n    \n    And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \n    \n    Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \n    \n    Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can\u2019t be sued. \n    \n    These laws don\u2019t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \n    \n    The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote \u2013 and to have it counted. And it\u2019s under assault. \n    \n    In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \n    \n    We cannot let this happen. \n    \n    Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you\u2019re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n    \n    Tonight, I\u2019d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer\u2014an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n    \n    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n    \n    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\u2019s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\u2019s legacy of excellence. \n    \n    A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she\u2019s been nominated, she\u2019s received a broad range of support\u2014from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \n    \n    And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \n    \n    We can do both. At our border, we\u2019ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \n    \n    We\u2019ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \n    \n    We\u2019re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster.\n"))))}h.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
