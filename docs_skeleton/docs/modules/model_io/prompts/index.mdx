# Prompts

The new way of programming models is through prompts.
A **prompt** refers to the input to the model.
This input is often constructed from multiple components.
A **PromptTemplate** is responsible for the construction of this input.
LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with prompts easy.

- [Prompt templates](./prompt_templates.html): Parametrize model inputs 

- [Example selectors](./example_selectors.html): Dynamically select examples to include in prompts
