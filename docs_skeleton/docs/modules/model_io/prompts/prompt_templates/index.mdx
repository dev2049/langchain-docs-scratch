# Prompt templates

Language models take text as input - that text is commonly referred to as a prompt.
Typically this is not simply a hardcoded string but rather a combination of a template, some examples, and user input.
LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with prompts easy.

For advanced usage, check out the **How-to** section.

## What is a prompt template?

A prompt template refers to a reproducible way to generate a prompt. It contains a text string ("the template"), that can take in a set of parameters from the end user and generate a prompt.

The prompt template may contain:
- instructions to the language model,
- a set of few shot examples to help the language model generate a better response,
- a question to the language model.

Here's an example:

import GetStarted from "@snippets/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/get_started.mdx"

<GetStarted/>
