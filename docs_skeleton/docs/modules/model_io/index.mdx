# Model I/O

The core element of any language model application is...the model. LangChain gives you the building blocks to interface with any language model.

- [Models](./models.html): Make calls to language models through common interfaces
- [Prompts](./prompts.html): Templatize, update, and manage model inputs
- [Output parsers](./output_parsers.html): Extract information from model outputs
