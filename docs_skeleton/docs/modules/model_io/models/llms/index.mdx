# LLMs

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a core component of LangChain.
LangChain is not a provider of LLMs, but rather provides a standard interface through which
you can interact with a variety of LLMs.

For more detailed documentation check out our:

- **How-to guides**: Walkthroughs of core functionality, like streaming, async, etc.

- **Integrations**: How to use different LLM providers (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc).

## Get started

The LLM class is a class designed for interfacing with LLMs. There are lots of LLM providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them. In this part of the documentation, we will focus on generic LLM functionality. For details on working with a specific LLM wrapper, please see the examples in the [How-To section](how_to_guides.rst).

In this walkthrough we'll work with an OpenAI LLM wrapper, although the functionalities highlighted are generic for all LLM types.
