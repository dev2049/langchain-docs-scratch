# Document loaders

Use document loaders to load data from a source as `Document`'s. A `Document` is a piece of text
and associated metadata. For example, there are document loaders for loading a simple `.txt` file, for loading the text
contents of any web page, or even for loading a transcript of a YouTube video.

Every document loader exposes two methods:
1. "Load": load documents from the configured source
2. "Load and split": load documents from the configured source and split them using the passed in text splitter

They optionally implement:

3. "Lazy load": load documents into memory lazily
