# Data I/O

Many LLM applications require user-specific data that is not part of the model's training set. LangChain gives you the 
building blocks to connect, manage, and interface with your data via:

- [Document loaders](./document_loaders.html): Load documents from many different sources
- [Document transformers](./text_splitters.html): Split documents, drop redundant documents, and more
- [Vector stores](./vectorstores.html): Store and search over embedded data
- [Retrievers](./retrievers.html): Query your data
