# Time Weighted VectorStore

This retriever uses a combination of semantic similarity and a time decay.

The algorithm for scoring them is:

```python
semantic_similarity + (1.0 - decay_rate) ** hours_passed
```

Notably, `hours_passed` refers to the hours passed since the object in the retriever **was last accessed**, not since it was created. This means that frequently accessed objects remain "fresh."
