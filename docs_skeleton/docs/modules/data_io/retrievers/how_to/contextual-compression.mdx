# Contextual Compression

This notebook introduces the concept of DocumentCompressors and the ContextualCompressionRetriever. The core idea is simple: given a specific query, we should be able to return only the documents relevant to that query, and only the parts of those documents that are relevant. The ContextualCompressionsRetriever is a wrapper for another retriever that iterates over the initial output of the base retriever and filters and compresses those initial documents, so that only the most relevant information is returned.
